## Objectives

The goal of this project was to design a part that had the highest strength-to-weight ratio in an engineering class competition. The competition also had requirements to include several holes which purposefully weaken the part, making the task more challenging. Our task was to design around those requirements and to construct a part that could support the most load with the least amount of material.

## Outcomes

My teammate and I created a part which achieved a strength-to-weight ratio of 75.86 N/g, winning second place in our in-class competition. Our part weighed just 16 grams and held 1161 N of force before it broke.

## Methods Used

We used Solidworks to create CAD models for the part and ANSYS FEA to conduct simulations. We also conducted topology optimization studies to further refine our designs using Solidworks Simulations.

## Overview
For my product design course project, I designed and fabricated a product prototype for a ping pong ball launcher with my teammates Hammad Anwer, Vanshaj Malhotra, and Dong To Khoa. We aimed to create an educational product that would teach projectile physics to children in a fun and engaging way. 

## Methods Used
We researched the toy market to identify customer needs and used competitive benchmarking to position our product. In the second half, we made a mechanical design that would meet the needs of the market segment, and then constructed a prototype of our design to test and validate our concept. 
Challenges we encountered were determining what the final price of the product should be based on market demand, manufacturing costs, and development costs, dimensioning the part geometry carefully so the launch trajectory of the ping pong ball was exactly how we intended, optimizing the part for 3D printing to minimize printing time, and then tuning our prototype to reduce the amount of deviation in the launch trajectories (added latch to improve firing, fastened base using screws instead of Velcro).

## Outcomes
We successfully created a prototype that can hit a bucket 0.5 feet wide from 16 feet away. Using this prototype, we were able to complete a Design of Experiment that modelled the product's performance with a Response Surface. During an in-class demonstration of our product, we used our Response Surface to correctly predict the launch angle and spring extension required for our product to score inside of a target placed a random distance away. Future work on the project could improve its manufacturability using injection molding machines and add theming to the product.

title: The Bloomba: An autonomous plant-watering robot demonstration
description:  For my fourth year undergraduate Capstone project, I was team leader for the design and prototyping of autonomous plant watering robot. It uses a LIDAR sensor to measure its surroundings and a SLAM algorithm to navigate. We also built a custom watering arm to water pots that are placed up to 130 cm high. To accurately locate the plant pots, it can also use computer vision to identify April Tags placed on the pots.

- ROS2/Linux programming

### External images
{% include image-gallery.html images="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52821641477_d397e56bc4_k.jpg, https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52822650673_f074b20d90_k.jpg" height="400"%}
<span style="font-size: 10px">"Starship Test Flight Mission" from https://www.flickr.com/photos/spacex/52821641477/</span>  
You can put in multiple entries. All images will be at a fixed height in the same row. With smaller window, they will switch to columns.  

### Embeed images
{% include image-gallery.html images="project2.jpg" height="400" %} 
place the images in project folder/images then update the file path.   


## Embedding youtube video
The second video has the autoplay on. copy and paste the 11-digit id found in the url link. <br>
*Example* : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v={**MhVw-MHGv4s**}&ab_channel=engineerguy
{% include youtube-video.html id="MhVw-MHGv4s" autoplay= "false"%}
